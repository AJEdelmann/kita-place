# PROJECT: KITA PLACE

## ISSUE TO BE SOLVED

- The parents daily struggle to find a Kita place for their Kids. The lack of information regarding open places and application process agravates the situation.

- Timeloss and emotional exhaustion for parents.
- Unnecessary effort and duplicated work for Kita administration personnel.


## OUR SOLUTION
